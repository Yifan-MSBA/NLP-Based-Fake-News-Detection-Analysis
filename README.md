# Semantic Understanding and Deep Learning: A Robust Approach to Fake News Detection

This project focused on fake news detection using NLP techniques, addressing a crucial issue in today's digital landscape. We used two main approaches, TF-IDF analysis with RNN and 
Word2Vec embeddings with RNN, driven by the assumption that fake news exhibts unique word frequency and semantic patterns. We effectively processed and analyzed the dataset, 
performed text preprocessing, and used descriptive and predictive analytics, achieving high accuracy in detecting fake news, especially with the Word2Vec approach. The successful 
results provide robust models for preventing the spread of fake news, benefiting social media platforms, email apps, and PR-involved organizations. The project's approach and results 
emphasize the role of semantic understanding in distinguishing real news from fake news and provide pathways for future enhancements.
